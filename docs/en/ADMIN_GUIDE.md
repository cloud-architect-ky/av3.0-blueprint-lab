# AV 3.0 Blueprint Lab — Admin Guide

Everything the workshop admin does **before, during, and after** the event, in the
order you'll do it. Participants only need their dashboard link (see
[PARTICIPANT_GUIDE.md](PARTICIPANT_GUIDE.md)); everything else is on you.

> **Golden rule:** all the heavy, gated, GPU, and credential work is the admin's.
> If you finish the pre-event checklist below, a participant can run M0–M12 from a
> browser with **no AWS account, no Hugging Face token, and no license clicks**
> (the one exception is the optional M10 self-run — see §7).

---

## 0. What you are operating

- **One CDK stack** (`Av30PlatformStack`) → VPC, KMS-encrypted S3 (shared + per-user
  workspace), DynamoDB, Cognito, WAF, API Gateway + Lambda, 2 CloudFront dashboards
  (admin + user), and a SageMaker Studio domain whose participants all share ONE
  execution role, `av30lab-sagemaker-execution-role` (not one role per user). Isolation
  between participants comes from IAM policy conditions comparing a space's owner against
  `${sagemaker:UserProfileName}` — see the residual-risk note in
  `infra/av30_constructs/sagemaker.py`.
- **Two S3 buckets** (names are derived from **your** account + region — the
  examples in this guide use account `<aws-account-id>` / `us-west-2`, the reference
  deployment; substitute your own — see §1.5):
  - `av30lab-shared-data-<account>-<region>` — models, datasets, notebook templates, M10 reference.
  - `av30lab-user-workspace-<account>-<region>` — one `users/<id>/` prefix per participant.

> **Note on the IDs in this guide.** Everywhere you see `<aws-account-id>` or
> `us-west-2` (bucket names, ARNs, quota "current" values, CLI examples), those
> are from the reference deployment. They are **not** hard-coded in the stack —
> the account is taken from your credentials and the region from `$AWS_REGION`
> at deploy time (§5). Pick yours in §1.5, then read the examples with your own
> values substituted.
- **13 notebooks M0–M12**. Most are participant-self-service; a few need one-time
  admin pre-work (models, datasets, the M10 reference run). See the matrix in §4.

## 1. Pre-event timeline

| When | Task | Why the lead time |
|---|---|---|
| **Day −7** | Request GPU + job quota increases (§2) | Approvals take 24–48 h, sometimes longer |
| **Day −7** | Accept all gated HF licenses on your admin account (§3) | Instant, but easy to forget one |
| **Day −3** | `cdk bootstrap` + `deploy.sh` (§5) | ~25 min; leaves time to fix issues |
| **Day −3** | Stage nuScenes + pre-cache models + HF offline cache (§6) | 30–90 min of background transfers |
| **Day −2** | Run the M10 AlpaSim reference eval on EC2 (§6.4), if using M10 | ~$30, tens of min–2 h on a GPU box |
| **Day −1** | Upload notebook templates, smoke-test one user end-to-end (§8) | Catches provisioning/quota gaps |
| **Day 0** | Provision participants, hand out dashboard links (§9), monitor (§10) | — |
| **Day +0** | Delete users, **revoke HF token, rotate NGC key** (§12) | Security hygiene |

---

## 1.5. Choosing your AWS account and Region (do this first)

The platform is **account- and region-agnostic** — nothing in the stack pins the
reference account (`<aws-account-id>`) or region (`us-west-2`). Everything derives at
deploy time: the **account** from your AWS credentials, and the **region** from the
`AWS_REGION` you export in §5. Decide both before you request quotas (§2), because
GPU quotas and gated-model availability are per-account **and** per-region.

**Choosing the account**
- Use an account **you are an admin of** (or have IAM rights to create roles,
  Cognito pools, CloudFront, VPCs, and SageMaker domains). `deploy.sh` runs
  `cdk bootstrap`, which needs elevated permissions once per account+region.
- Prefer a **dedicated / sandbox** account: the stack creates a Studio domain,
  buckets, and a WAF, and teardown (`scripts/teardown.sh`) is cleanest when it
  isn't sharing the account with unrelated production resources.
- Whatever account your credentials point at when you run `deploy.sh` is where it
  lands. Confirm before deploying:
  ```bash
  aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text
  ```
  This account id is what fills the `<account>` in every bucket name and ARN.

**Choosing the Region** — this matters more than the account, because it gates GPU
capacity and model access:
- **GPU availability varies by region.** The GPU families this lab uses (`g5`,
  `g6`, and optionally `p4d`/`p5`) are **not** in every region, and quota approvals
  are per-region. Pick a region with strong GPU capacity — `us-west-2` (Oregon)
  and `us-east-1` (N. Virginia) are the safest; **`ml.p5.48xlarge` in particular
  is only offered in a few regions (us-west-2 / us-east-1).**
- **Latency:** closer to the participants is nicer for the interactive Studio UI,
  but capacity should win the tie — a region where you can't get GPUs is useless.
- **Data residency / org policy:** if your organisation restricts regions, choose a
  compliant one that still has the GPU families above.
- **Model + dataset staging is region-local.** The HF/model caches and nuScenes are
  staged into the shared bucket **in your chosen region** (§6); if you later move
  regions you must re-stage (see the "Region portability" note in `README.md`).

**Verify a candidate region has the capacity you need** before committing (empty
output for a family means it isn't offered there):
```bash
export AWS_REGION="us-west-2"     # your candidate
# GPU instance types offered for SageMaker Studio apps in this region:
aws service-quotas list-service-quotas --service-code sagemaker --region "$AWS_REGION" \
  --query "Quotas[?contains(QuotaName,'Studio JupyterLab Apps running on ml.g6') || contains(QuotaName,'Studio JupyterLab Apps running on ml.g5')].{Name:QuotaName,Current:Value,Code:QuotaCode}" \
  --output table
```

Once account + region are settled, export `AWS_REGION` (§5 uses it throughout),
request the quotas in §2 **in that region**, and stage caches (§6) **in that
region**. Changing either later means re-bootstrapping, re-quota-ing, and
re-staging — so lock it in now.

---

## 2. Service quotas (request Day −7)

Two families of quota matter. The README's quota table covers the first; the
**job quotas** below are easy to miss and block M12/M11 for a full room.

### 2a. Studio JupyterLab App quotas (interactive notebooks)
Search "**Studio JupyterLab Apps running on**" in the Service Quotas console. These
are the instance types the **user dashboard's Instance Options** actually offers
(recommended + alternatives), so a participant can only pick from this set — the
quotas below cover every one of them. Quota **codes are region-independent** (verified
identical across us-west-2 / ap-northeast-2 / eu-west-1); the **values are not**, and
neither is which types have a quota at all.

**GPU workhorse: `ml.g5.12xlarge` (4× A10G, 96 GB).** It is what the dashboard now
recommends for M2, M3 and the four heavy modules (M5, M6, M8, M9), for reasons that are
all measured: it has the *identical* geometry to `ml.g6.24xlarge` (`describe-instance-types`
reports 4 GPUs × 22,888 MiB for both, so every per-GPU module gate takes the same branch),
it is cheaper in both regions ($7.09 vs $8.34 in us-west-2; $8.72 vs $10.26 in
ap-northeast-2), it has a higher quota (5 vs 2 in us-west-2, 5 vs **0** in ap-northeast-2),
and both of the lab's captured passes are reachable from it. Be precise about what is
measured, because an earlier version of this guide had it backwards: the 4-GPU Run-All
captured in `examples/notebooks-with-outputs.tar.gz` (M2, M5, M6, M9 — M9 at minADE
0.3805, `Status: PASS`) ran on **4x NVIDIA L4**, i.e. genuinely g6.24xlarge geometry AND
silicon; `docs/en/ALPAMAYO_M9.md:181-187` separately records M9 passing on **8x A10G**
(g5.48xlarge). So (4 GPUs) and (A10G) are each measured while the 4xA10G pair is not, and
no heavy module branches on anything but per-GPU VRAM and GPU count — so it cannot
diverge. The reason to prefer g5.12xlarge is quota and price, not verification.
p4d/p5 remain the native-resolution / full-720p path if you have the quota.

> **The `us-west-2` column below is not your region.** Quota is a per-(account × region)
> fact: the entire `ml.g6.*` family is sold in ap-northeast-2 with a quota of **0**, and
> `ml.g7e.*`/`ml.p5.*` are not sold there at all. Run
> `./scripts/check_quotas.py --region <target>` for the real numbers — it prints the exact
> `request-service-quota-increase` command for each shortfall. (A quota-0 type is now
> rejected by the dashboard up front rather than accepted and then failing to start.)

| Instance | Quota code | us-west-2 (2026-09) | Min for a 10-person room | Role in the dashboard |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ml.t3.medium | L-71FAF417 | 2500 | ≥20 | **Recommended** for all CPU notebooks (M0, M1, M10, M4, M12, M11) |
| ml.t3.large | L-2733D4D5 | 30 | ≥0 | CPU alternative |
| ml.t3.xlarge | L-61F9C762 | 30 | ≥0 | CPU alternative (M1) |
| ml.m5.large | L-3BDCD216 | 11 | ≥0 | CPU alternative |
| ml.m5.xlarge | L-77B8159A | 11 | ≥0 | CPU alternative (M12) |
| ml.g5.xlarge | L-988CE6C5 | 5 | ≥5 | **Recommended** for M7 (Nerfstudio) |
| ml.g5.2xlarge | L-F73C7DB9 | 5 | ≥0 | M7 alternative |
| ml.g5.4xlarge | L-81940D85 | 5 | ≥0 | M7 alternative |
| **ml.g5.12xlarge** | **L-8D2ED7BF** | **5** | **≥5** | **Recommended workhorse — M2, M3, M5, M6, M8, M9 (4× A10G, 96 GB)** |
| ml.g5.24xlarge | L-F087CCFC | 2 | ≥1 | M2/M3/M5–M9 alternative |
| ml.g5.48xlarge | L-83AB5D73 | 2 | ≥1 | M2/M3/M5–M9 alternative / OOM fallback |
| ml.g6.xlarge | L-AABA5942 | 5 | ≥0 | M7 alternative (L4) — **0 in ap-northeast-2** |
| ml.g6.2xlarge | L-92D1521D | 5 | ≥0 | M7 alternative (L4) — **0 in ap-northeast-2** |
| ml.g6.4xlarge | L-692B8304 | 5 | ≥0 | M7 alternative (L4) — **0 in ap-northeast-2** |
| ml.g6.12xlarge | L-962247BA | 2 | ≥0 | M2/M3 capacity fallback (4× L4, 96 GB) — **0 in ap-northeast-2** |
| ml.g6.24xlarge | L-8ACE1754 | 2 | ≥0 | M2/M3/M5–M9 alternative (4× L4, 96 GB) — same geometry as g5.12xlarge but dearer; **0 in ap-northeast-2** |
| ml.g6.48xlarge | L-125B7142 | 2 | ≥0 | M5/M6/M9 alternative (8× L4) — **0 in ap-northeast-2** |
| ml.g7e.2xlarge | L-7A3E0A2C | **0** | ≥0 | M2/M3/M5–M9 **cheapest native-res path** (1× RTX PRO 6000, 96 GB; **defaults to 0 — must request**) |
| ml.g7e.24xlarge | L-E481E4F8 | **0** | ≥0 | M5/M6/M9 alternative (4× RTX PRO 6000; **defaults to 0**) |
| ml.p4d.24xlarge | L-AD63F1D2 | 2 | ≥2 | M5, M6, M9 native-res path (8× A100; **defaults to 0 — must request**) |
| ml.p5.48xlarge | L-B41FBF28 | 1 | ≥0 | Heavy-model fallback (8× H100; **not sold in ap-northeast-2**) |

> **g7e is optional and unverified here.** All six `ml.g7e.*` Studio quotas read
> **0** in `us-west-2` for this account (verified via `list-service-quotas`), so
> nobody can select it until you request an increase. It is listed because it is
> the *cheapest* way to the native-resolution tier — one 96 GB card at ~$4.20/hr
> beats `ml.p4d.24xlarge` at ~$25.25/hr and even undercuts the 24 GB default
> (~$8.34/hr) — but **no module has been run end-to-end on g7e in this lab**. If
> you request it, smoke-test M5 on one user before pointing a room at it. Other
> g7e sizes (4xl/8xl/12xl/48xl) have quota codes too (L-B7228EBF, L-0407753C,
> L-5F015F52, L-A48244DF) but are not offered in the dashboard.

Sizing the room: request the **recommended** instance for each module at ≥ the
number of concurrent participants, and at least the minimum shown for the one or
two fallbacks you intend to steer people to (capacity errors surface an
alternative in the dashboard). You do **not** need quota for every alternative —
only the ones you'll actually direct the room to use. If you standardise the GPU
modules on **g5.12xlarge** (recommended — and the only heavy-module recommendation that
is non-zero in both us-west-2 and ap-northeast-2), request that one to ≥ your headcount
and you can leave p4d/p5 at their defaults.

### 2b. SageMaker **job** quotas (M12 and M11 — the ones people forget)
M12 submits a real **training job** and M11 runs real **processing jobs** on
separate managed instances (not the notebook's instance). These have their own
quotas:

| Quota | Code | Verified value (reference deploy example: us-west-2) | Needed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| ml.m5.xlarge for **training** job usage | L-CCE2AFA6 | 30 | M12 (needs ≥2 — it's a 2-node job) |
| ml.m5.xlarge for **processing** job usage | L-0307F515 | 16 | M11 (needs ≥1 — sequential 3-step DAG) |

Both are comfortably above the workshop's needs today, but **verify** — if either
is 0 in your account, M12/M11 fail at job submission even though the notebook opens.
Note `ml.g5.*` **processing** job quota is 0 here; that's fine because M11 runs on
CPU by design.

```bash
# Check everything at once:
aws service-quotas list-service-quotas --service-code sagemaker --region "$AWS_REGION" \
  --query "Quotas[?contains(QuotaName,'Studio JupyterLab Apps') || contains(QuotaName,'for training job') || contains(QuotaName,'for processing job')].{Name:QuotaName,Value:Value,Code:QuotaCode}" \
  --output table

# Request an increase (the two types the dashboard actually recommends, to 10 for a full room):
aws service-quotas request-service-quota-increase \
  --service-code sagemaker --quota-code L-8D2ED7BF --desired-value 10 --region "$AWS_REGION"   # ml.g5.12xlarge
aws service-quotas request-service-quota-increase \
  --service-code sagemaker --quota-code L-988CE6C5 --desired-value 10 --region "$AWS_REGION"   # ml.g5.xlarge
```

> The quota **codes** above are the same in every region; run these against
> **your** `$AWS_REGION` (§5) so you're requesting capacity where you'll actually
> deploy. GPU availability varies by region — see §1.5 for choosing one.

## 3. Gated Hugging Face + NGC licenses (accept Day −7)

On **your admin HF account**, click "Agree and access repository" on each. This is
the only place licenses are accepted — participants never see this.

| Repo | Needed by | License |
|---|---|---|
| nvidia/Cosmos-Reason1-7B | M2 | NVIDIA Open Model (not gated, but log in) |
| nvidia/Cosmos-Guardrail1 | M5, M6 | NVIDIA Open Model |
| nvidia/Cosmos-Transfer2.5-2B | M5 | NVIDIA Open Model |
| nvidia/Cosmos-Predict2.5-2B | M6 | NVIDIA Open Model |
| nvidia/Alpamayo-1.5-10B | M9, M10 | **Non-commercial** (research/eval only) |
| nvidia/Cosmos-Reason2-8B | M9, M10 (hidden Alpamayo backbone) | NVIDIA Open Model |
| nvidia/PhysicalAI-Autonomous-Vehicles | M9 (demo clip) | NVIDIA AV Dataset (12-month expiry) |
| nvidia/PhysicalAI-Autonomous-Vehicles-NuRec | M10 (AlpaSim scenes) | NVIDIA AV NuRec Dataset |

**M10 also needs NGC** (separate from HF): the NuRec renderer image
`nvcr.io/nvidia/nre/nre-ga:26.04`. Get a key at
`https://org.ngc.nvidia.com/setup/api-key`. (In testing this image was
anonymously pullable, but have a key ready in case that changes.)

> Set `export HF_TOKEN=hf_...` once you've accepted everything; you'll use it in §6.

---

## 4. Per-module admin pre-work matrix

This is the heart of the guide — **which modules need admin work vs. run themselves.**

| Module | Compute (what participant sees) | Admin pre-work required | Doc |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 Overview | CPU t3.medium | none | — |
| M1 Data Exploration | CPU t3.medium | Stage nuScenes-mini (§6.1) | — |
| M2 Cosmos Reason | GPU g5.12xlarge (or g6.24xlarge) | Pre-cache model to `model-cache/` (§6.2) | — |
| M3 Cosmos Curator | GPU g5.12xlarge (or g6.24xlarge) | (uses M2 output; no extra cache) | — |
| M4 OpenSearch | CPU t3.medium | (uses M2 output; no extra cache) | — |
| M5 Cosmos Transfer | GPU g6.24xlarge (or p4d.24xlarge for 720p) | HF **offline cache** to `hf-cache/hub/` (§6.3) | [COSMOS_M5_M6.md](COSMOS_M5_M6.md) |
| M6 Cosmos Predict | GPU g6.24xlarge (or p4d.24xlarge for native) | HF offline cache (§6.3) | [COSMOS_M5_M6.md](COSMOS_M5_M6.md) |
| M7 Nerfstudio | GPU g5.xlarge (or g6.xlarge) | gsplat CUDA build runs per-session via `scripts/setup_gsplat_env.sh` (§11) | See §11 below |
| M8 Cosmos Reason SFT | GPU g6.24xlarge (or g7e.2xlarge) | (reuses M2's `model-cache/cosmos-reason1/`; no extra cache) | — |
| M9 Alpamayo VLA | GPU g6.24xlarge (or p4d.24xlarge) | HF offline cache **+ demo clip** (§6.3) | [ALPAMAYO_M9.md](ALPAMAYO_M9.md) |
| M10 AlpaSim | CPU t3.medium (visualizer) | **Run reference eval on EC2 once** (§6.4) | [ALPASIM_M10.md](ALPASIM_M10.md) |
| M11 Pipeline | CPU t3.medium (runs real SageMaker Pipeline) | none (job quota §2b) | [PIPELINE_M11.md](PIPELINE_M11.md) |
| M12 HyperPod | CPU t3.medium (submits real DDP job) | none (job quota §2b) | [HYPERPOD_M12.md](HYPERPOD_M12.md) |

**Bottom line:** the required one-time admin caches are **nuScenes (M1) + model-cache
(M2) + hf-cache (M5/M6/M9) + M9 demo clip**, plus the **M10 reference run** if you're
running M10. M12 and M11 need **no cache** — just the job quotas in §2b.

---

## 5. Deploy the platform (Day −3)

> **Region is explicit, and a redeploy is guarded.** Pass `--region` — there is no default
> anywhere in the deploy path. On an UPDATE of an existing stack, `deploy.sh` now reads the
> live state and **refuses** rather than doing something destructive silently: it stops if
> the deploy would change the stack's `Owner` tag (which replaces the Studio domain, losing
> every participant workspace and orphaning the EFS), and it stops on any wrong combination
> of `HOSTED_UI_DOMAIN_EXISTS` (either declaring a Cognito domain that already exists
> unmanaged, or deleting one the stack does own). Each refusal prints the exact command to
> re-run. A brand-new region needs none of these flags.
> To stand up an ADDITIONAL region, see [../en/ADDING_A_REGION.md](ADDING_A_REGION.md).


```bash
# Required env
export ADMIN_EMAIL="you@example.com"       # becomes the Cognito admin + SNS alert target
export REGION="us-west-2"                  # YOUR chosen region (§1.5) — passed explicitly below
export AWS_REGION="$REGION"                # the seeding scripts in §6 read this
export HF_TOKEN="hf_..."                    # for the caching steps in §6
# Optional: lock the admin dashboard to your IP
export ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST="203.0.113.0/24" # default 0.0.0.0/0

# One-time CDK bootstrap (per account+region)
cd infra && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
npx cdk bootstrap aws://$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)/$REGION
cd ..

# Generate this region's instance rate table (REQUIRED — the Lambdas raise at import
# without it rather than quoting another region's prices)
./scripts/refresh_instance_rates.py --region "$REGION" --merge

# Deploy stack + build/upload both dashboards (~25 min). Region is explicit.
./scripts/deploy.sh --region "$REGION"
```

`deploy.sh` passes `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST` and the resolved region to CDK via
`--context` (**not** env vars). If you skip `deploy.sh` and run `cdk deploy` by hand you must
pass `--context admin_email=...` — omitting it does not fail, it silently replaces your alert
email with `placeholder@example.com` and **deletes the real subscription**, including a
confirmed one. It prints the **Admin Dashboard URL** and **API endpoint** at the end, plus a
GPU-quota pre-flight and a warning if the account has no account-wide budget.

**Create the admin login** (username must be the email — Cognito uses email as the
sign-in alias):
```bash
aws cognito-idp admin-create-user \
  --user-pool-id <POOL_ID_FROM_DEPLOY_OUTPUT> \
  --username "$ADMIN_EMAIL" \
  --user-attributes Name=email,Value=$ADMIN_EMAIL Name=email_verified,Value=true \
  --temporary-password 'TempPass1!' --region $AWS_REGION
```
Log in to the admin dashboard; you'll be forced to set a new password.

---

## 6. One-time data + model staging (Day −3 to −2)

All of these write to the **shared** bucket. Steps 6.3/6.4 must run on a machine
that can reach the gated repos with your token.

### 6.1 nuScenes-mini (M1/M2/M7)
```bash
./scripts/stage_nuscenes.sh    # pulls the public AWS Open Data mirror → datasets/nuscenes-mini/
```

### 6.2 Simple model cache (M2/M3)
```bash
pip install huggingface_hub && hf auth login --token "$HF_TOKEN"
./scripts/cache_models.sh      # → s3://<shared>/model-cache/ (Cosmos-Reason1-7B, Transfer2.5, Predict2.5)
```

### 6.3 HF offline cache (M5/M6/M9) — the "no participant token" trick
M5/M6/M9 load gated checkpoints through HF's **own cache layout** at runtime
(M9 also pulls a hidden Cosmos-Reason2-8B backbone). The robust way to populate it:
**run M5, M6, and M9 once each on a GPU JupyterLab app** with your admin token,
then sync the cache tree:
```bash
aws s3 sync /mnt/sagemaker-nvme/hf/hub s3://<shared>/hf-cache/hub/ --only-show-errors
```
`setup_cosmos_env.sh` restores this into `HF_HOME` and sets `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`, so
participants run offline with no token. **M9 also needs a demo clip** (its dataset
can't be read offline):
```bash
source /mnt/sagemaker-nvme/cosmos-work/alpamayo_env.sh
unset HF_HUB_OFFLINE TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE   # this save must be online
python scripts/alpamayo_save_clip.py --clip 030c760c-ae38-49aa-9ad8-f5650a545d26 \
  --t0-us 5100000 --out /mnt/sagemaker-nvme/m6_work/clips
aws s3 cp /mnt/sagemaker-nvme/m6_work/clips/030c760c-*.pt s3://<shared>/hf-cache/alpamayo-demo/
```
Full sequence: [COSMOS_M5_M6.md](COSMOS_M5_M6.md), [ALPAMAYO_M9.md](ALPAMAYO_M9.md).

### 6.4 M10 AlpaSim reference eval (only if running M10)
AlpaSim is a Docker-Compose microservice system needing a ≥40 GB GPU — it
**cannot run in a Studio notebook**. Run it once on a Docker-capable GPU EC2 host:
```bash
# On a Deep Learning Base GPU AMI box (g6e.12xlarge, public subnet):
ACCOUNT=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
export HF_TOKEN=hf_... NGC_API_KEY=nvapi-...
# Do NOT export SHARED_BUCKET: the script derives av30lab-shared-data-<acct>-<region>
# itself and exits 1 if it cannot. An exported value overrides that and, if it is
# missing the region suffix, silently targets a bucket that does not exist.
bash scripts/alpasim_ec2_setup.sh    # → uploads s3://<shared>/m10-reference/
# then TERMINATE the instance.
```
The M10 notebook (CPU) downloads and visualizes these results for every participant.
~$30 one-time; participant cost $0. Full details + the optional participant
self-run path: [ALPASIM_M10.md](ALPASIM_M10.md), [M10_MANUAL_TEST_RUNBOOK.md](M10_MANUAL_TEST_RUNBOOK.md).

### 6.5 Upload notebook templates + scripts (do this LAST, after any notebook edits)
```bash
# <shared> = av30lab-shared-data-<account>-<region>. $AWS_REGION is the value exported in §5 (or: export AWS_REGION=...)
aws s3 sync notebooks/ s3://<shared>/notebook-templates/ --region "$AWS_REGION" \
    --exclude "*__pycache__*" --exclude "*.pyc"
aws s3 sync scripts/   s3://<shared>/notebook-templates/scripts/ --region "$AWS_REGION" \
    --exclude "*__pycache__*" --exclude "*.pyc"
```

> **Re-syncing into a bucket that already holds the pre-renumbering notebooks?**
> `aws s3 sync` does not delete, so the old names (`M4_Cosmos_Transfer_…`,
> `M8_OpenSearch_…`, `M9_HyperPod_…`, `M10_Nerfstudio_…`) would sit alongside the new
> ones and participants would see both. Do **not** add `--delete` — that would also
> wipe the `notebook-templates/scripts/` folder, which this sync does not repopulate.

These are copied into each user's workspace at provisioning time (and the notebooks
fall back to downloading scripts from this path). **Re-run this whenever you change
a notebook or script** — otherwise participants get the old version. Participants
already provisioned can re-sync from a JupyterLab terminal:
`aws s3 cp s3://<shared>/notebook-templates/<NB>.ipynb ~/`.

> **Note on `scripts/patch_notebooks.py`:** a manual, in-place `.ipynb` transformer
> from an earlier bootstrap. It is **NOT wired into any automation** (deploy, CDK,
> or provisioning) — the repo `notebooks/*.ipynb` are the single source of truth.
> Every module entry is now `[]` (a no-op); the tool **hard-fails** if a notebook
> ever drifts from its expected patterns, so it can never silently ship an
> unpatched notebook. You normally never run it — edit the notebook directly and
> re-sync via §6.5. The cross-module S3 contract those notebooks rely on is in
> [DATA_CONTRACT.md](DATA_CONTRACT.md).

## 7. Optional: M10 participant self-run (advanced)

By default every participant shares your one M10 reference eval (§6.4) and needs no
token. If you instead want **each participant to run AlpaSim themselves** on their
own admin-provisioned GPU host over SSM:
- You pre-provision a GPU EC2 host per participant and grant least-privilege SSM
  access (exact-ARN or ABAC). **Participants cannot terminate hosts — you do**
  (cost-runaway guard).
- Each participant needs **their own HF token** (the NuRec dataset is gated and not
  in the shared cache).
- Cost ~$10.5/hr/host, ≤16 concurrent by the G-vCPU quota.

Full runbooks: [M10_MANUAL_TEST_RUNBOOK.md](M10_MANUAL_TEST_RUNBOOK.md) Part C (admin
provisioning + IAM) and [M10_PARTICIPANT_SSM_RUNBOOK.md](M10_PARTICIPANT_SSM_RUNBOOK.md)
(participant steps). This is opt-in; skip it for a standard workshop.

## 8. Smoke test (Day −1) — prove one user works end-to-end

1. Admin Dashboard → **Add User** → test name + email → **Provision**.
2. Copy the **Participant Dashboard Link** from the success dialog (the durable
   `?userId=&token=` link — **not** the 5-minute "Direct workspace URL").
3. Open that link in a fresh browser → the Pipeline Map with 12 module nodes renders (M1-M12; M0 is the overview notebook and has no node).
4. Click **M2** → **Instance Options** → recommended `ml.g5.12xlarge` preselected →
   **Apply & Restart** → **Open Workspace** → JupyterLab opens.
4b. **Settle whether the scoped IAM conditions resolve (free, ~1 min).** While that app is
   running, open Studio *itself* as the test user — the Studio console, not the deep link —
   go to the space page and click **Run space**, then **Open JupyterLab**. Record whether
   either returns `AccessDenied` on `sagemaker:UpdateSpace` /
   `sagemaker:CreatePresignedDomainUrl`.
   - **No AccessDenied** → the `${sagemaker:DomainId}` / `${sagemaker:UserProfileName}`
     policy variables resolve live, so `CreateApp`/`DeleteApp` can be narrowed from
     `resources=["*"]` to the same owner condition. See the note on the
     `SageMakerStudioAppLifecycle` statement in `infra/av30_constructs/sagemaker.py`.
   - **AccessDenied** → they do not resolve in this account. Leave `CreateApp` broad, and
     keep telling participants to use the dashboard's button.
5. Run **M1** (CPU) end-to-end, then **M2** (GPU) — confirms the GPU image is
   auto-selected and the model cache resolves.
6. If you're running M12/M11, run one of each once as the test user to confirm the
   job quotas (§2b) and IAM are in place — they submit real managed jobs.
7. **Delete** the test user (Users tab → Delete) — removes app/space/profile + S3.

---

## 9. Provision participants (Day 0)

**Single user:** Admin Dashboard → **Add User** → name + email → **Provision**.
Hand them the **Participant Dashboard Link** (durable, non-expiring). The Users
table has a **Dashboard Link** column with a copy button per user.

**Bulk (CSV):** Admin Dashboard → bulk upload. The CSV needs a header row with
`name` and `email` columns (case-insensitive). Provisioning runs in parallel;
retry any failures individually.

Each participant gets: a SageMaker user profile + space, a `users/<id>/` S3 prefix
seeded with the notebook templates, and a personal dashboard link.

**Send participants two things:**
- **Before the event** — [PRE_LEARNING_GUIDE.md](PRE_LEARNING_GUIDE.md) (concepts +
  optional deeper-dive reading, ~45–60 min) so they arrive with context.
- **On the day** — their dashboard link + [PARTICIPANT_GUIDE.md](PARTICIPANT_GUIDE.md)
  (the click-by-click runbook).

## 10. During the workshop — monitor & control

- **Sessions tab** — live view of who's running what, on which instance, and cost.
- **Capacity errors** (`EC2InsufficientCapacityError`): tell participants to pick any
  alternative Instance Options offers for that module — the list is already filtered to
  types this region sells, and a type whose quota is 0 is refused with an explanation
  rather than accepted. Don't name a specific fallback from memory: `ml.g6.12xlarge` was
  the old advice and is quota 0 in ap-northeast-2. It's a capacity shortage, not a quota
  problem.
- **A change that silently didn't happen.** If a participant says their instance change
  did nothing, the app failed to launch on the new type (most often
  `ResourceLimitExceeded` — quota exists but every slot is in use) and was rolled back to
  the previous type so they still have a workspace. The reason is on
  `GET /sessions/{id}/app-status` as `lastInstanceChangeError`. Free a slot (force-terminate
  an idle session) and have them retry.
- **Cost control** — a daily budget alarm emails `ADMIN_EMAIL` via SNS; idle
  JupyterLab apps auto-stop after 90 min (`-c idle_timeout_minutes=<60..180>` to
  change). A running cell or terminal job counts as active, so this never kills work
  in progress. You can **force-terminate** any session from the Sessions tab. Watch for idle GPU boxes —
  the rate is per region, so quote your own: `ml.g5.12xlarge` (the default for five modules)
  is **$8.72/hr** in ap-northeast-2 and $7.09 in us-west-2; `ml.p4d.24xlarge` is **$34.97/hr**
  in ap-northeast-2 and $25.25 in us-west-2. See `infra/lambda/shared/instance_rates.py` for
  your region.
- **Storage cost is per participant and one-way.** Every space is created with a 200 GB gp3
  volume (`DEFAULT_SPACE_STORAGE_GB` in `infra/av30_constructs/__init__.py`). At
  $0.0912/GB-month in ap-northeast-2 that is **~$18.24 per participant per month**, billed
  whether or not the app is running — the idle timer deletes the app, not the volume. AWS does
  not allow SHRINKING a space's volume, and participants can grow it (+50/+200, ceiling 500 GB),
  so this only ever goes up until teardown removes the space.
- **GPU image reminder** — if a participant reports "No GPU detected" on a GPU
  instance, they launched the CPU image; Instance Options → GPU instance → Apply
  re-selects the GPU image.

## 11. M7 Nerfstudio — gsplat build (per-session)

**M7's training cell is UNVERIFIED — the repo contradicts itself.** This section used to
assert "M7 now trains". The notebook's own cell 0 says the opposite ("does NOT run on the
current image"), both claims arrived in the same commit, and the captured run retained
output for only 2 of 9 cells — so nobody has seen this pass or fail. One `ml.g5.xlarge`
Run-All (~$0.25, ~15 min) settles it; see `docs/en/TODO_M7_nerfstudio.md`. Until then,
treat M7 as the optional concept + data-prep demo the PARTICIPANT_GUIDE describes.

What the setup is *intended* to do, after a per-session gsplat CUDA
build: `gsplat` ships a pure-Python wheel and compiles its CUDA kernels from
source on first use, but the SageMaker Distribution image's conda CUDA dev
packages are incomplete. **`scripts/setup_gsplat_env.sh`** (M7 cell 3 invokes it)
fixes the whole chain: installs the missing dev headers, symlinks `nvvm` so `nvcc`
finds `cicc`, mirrors the CUDA headers/libs into the standard `$CUDA_HOME` paths
(so the build works with zero env vars, even inside `ns-train`'s subprocess), and
source-builds `gsplat==1.4.0`.

- It is **ephemeral** — the SMD app resets `/opt/conda` on restart, so the setup
  cell re-runs each session (~3–5 min cold, seconds when already built).
- The demo uses **synthetic sin-wave camera poses**, so training runs end-to-end
  (a genuine Gaussian-Splatting pipeline) but the reconstruction is a smoke test,
  not a metrically correct scene. Wiring real nuScenes calibration is the next step.
- **M7 caveat:** the gsplat CUDA build runs per-session via
  `scripts/setup_gsplat_env.sh`; treat M7 as an optional/demo module and expect the
  final training cell to be sensitive to the GPU image's CUDA toolchain.

## 12. Teardown & post-event security

- **One-shot teardown:** **`scripts/teardown.sh`** reclaims everything with the
  admin AWS creds. Dry-run by default (enumerates, changes nothing); `--yes` to
  act, `--user <id>` to scope to a single user, `--destroy` to also `cdk destroy`.
  Per user it deletes app→space→profile→AOSS→S3→DDB (same order as the delete_user
  Lambda), then runs a **global `av30-semantic-*` AOSS sweep** to catch any
  orphaned OpenSearch Serverless collection (these bill continuously — the sweep is
  the safety net), and terminates `Participant`+`av30-alpasim-*`-tagged GPU EC2
  hosts. It prints a manual HF/NGC key-revocation checklist at the end.
- **Delete a single user interactively:** Admin Dashboard → Users → **Delete**
  (same dependency order in one action).
- **Tear down the stack** (if the platform is temporary): `scripts/teardown.sh
  --yes --destroy`, or `cd infra && npx cdk destroy`. Note the shared-data bucket
  is RETAIN — it and its cached models survive a destroy and must be emptied by hand.
- **Revoke the admin HF token** `hf_...` — the S3 caches are all participants ever
  touch, so the token isn't needed after staging.
- **Rotate the NGC API key** if you used M10.
- The idle stack still costs ~$80/mo (NAT, VPC endpoints, DynamoDB, CloudFront) —
  destroy it if you're done.

## 13. Admin troubleshooting quick table

| Symptom | Cause / Fix |
|---|---|
| `ResourceLimitExceeded: ...Studio JupyterLab Apps... is 0` | GPU app quota not raised — §2a. |
| M12 job fails at submission (`AccessDeniedException` on `CreateTrainingJob`) | The exec-role's training-job ARN prefix must match the notebook's `JOB_NAME`. The module renumber moved HyperPod M9→M12 and the notebook now submits `av30-m12-distributed-*`; a deployment predating that fix still grants `av30-m9-*` and every submission is denied. The m5.xlarge **job** quota (§2b) is a separate, rarer cause — check the error first: `AccessDenied` = IAM prefix, `ResourceLimitExceeded` = quota. |
| Participant "No GPU detected" on a GPU instance | CPU image selected — re-Apply via Instance Options. |
| M5/M6/M9 ask for an HF token | `hf-cache/hub/` not staged (§6.3) — participants fall back to online download. |
| M7 training cell fails on gsplat | Re-run M7 cell 3 (`scripts/setup_gsplat_env.sh`) — the CUDA build is per-session and resets on app restart. §11. |
| M9 fails to load its clip | demo `.pt` not uploaded to `hf-cache/alpamayo-demo/` (§6.3). |
| M10 notebook shows nothing | `m10-reference/` reference eval not run (§6.4). |
| SNS budget alert went to placeholder@example.com | Deployed without `--context admin_email` — redeploy via `deploy.sh`. |
| Participant link shows "Demo Mode" | They opened the bare URL; resend the full `?userId=&token=` link. |
| Bulk provision partial failure | Retry failed rows individually; check `bulk_provision` CloudWatch logs. |
