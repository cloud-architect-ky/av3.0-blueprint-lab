# AV 3.0 Blueprint Lab

**Docs language:** **English** · [한국어](../ko/README.md) · [日本語](../ja/README.md)

A self-service AWS platform for hands-on execution of the [Building an End-to-End Physical AI Data Pipeline for Autonomous Vehicle 3.0 on AWS with NVIDIA](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/building-an-end-to-end-physical-ai-data-pipeline-for-autonomous-vehicle-3-0-on-aws-with-nvidia/).
Participants work through **13 Jupyter notebook modules
(M0–M12)** covering the full autonomous-vehicle data pipeline — data exploration,
video captioning (Cosmos Reason), data curation (Cosmos Curator), synthetic
augmentation (Cosmos Transfer & Predict), vision-language-action inference
(Alpamayo), closed-loop simulation (AlpaSim), semantic search, distributed
training, 3D reconstruction, and production pipeline automation.

The platform deploys as a **single AWS CDK stack** with admin + participant
dashboards, multi-user SageMaker Studio provisioning, and automated cost controls.
Anyone can deploy it into **their own AWS account**.

> This repository ships **workshop code and docs only**. It orchestrates
> third-party models and datasets (NVIDIA Cosmos/Alpamayo, nuScenes, NuRec) that
> you download yourself under **their own licenses** — some **non-commercial**.
> See [NOTICE](../../NOTICE).

## The 13 modules (M0-M12)

| Module | Blog stage | What it does | Recommended instance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **M0** | — | Pipeline overview — maps the end-to-end pipeline to the modules (no compute) | `ml.t3.medium` (CPU) |
| **M1** | 1–2 | Data Exploration — ingest & explore real **nuScenes-mini** sensor data; select scenes | `ml.t3.medium` (CPU) |
| **M2** | 3 | Cosmos Reason Captioning — VLM captions of sampled clips | `ml.g5.12xlarge` (GPU) |
| **M3** | 3 | Cosmos Curator — **NeMo Curator** video curation (split, transcode, motion-filter) | `ml.g5.12xlarge` (GPU) |
| **M4** | 4 | OpenSearch Semantic Search — k-NN retrieval over caption embeddings | `ml.t3.medium` (CPU) |
| **M5** | 5 | Cosmos Transfer — weather/condition augmentation of real clips | GPU (`ml.g5.12xlarge`) |
| **M6** | 5 (ext) | Cosmos Predict — synthetic scenario (video2world) generation | GPU (`ml.g5.12xlarge`) |
| **M7** | 6 | Nerfstudio 3D Reconstruction — NeRF / 3D Gaussian Splatting (optional/demo) | `ml.g5.xlarge` (GPU) |
| **M8** | 7 | Cosmos Reason LoRA SFT — parameter-efficient fine-tune on nuScenes **human** labels | GPU (`ml.g5.12xlarge`, native-res measured on 4× 24 GB) |
| **M9** | 7 | Alpamayo VLA — **Alpamayo-1.5-10B** vision-language-action inference + trajectory | GPU (`ml.g5.12xlarge`) |
| **M10** | 8 | AlpaSim Closed-Loop Eval — visualize genuine closed-loop policy evaluation | `ml.t3.medium` (CPU) + GPU EC2 |
| **M11** | — (ext) | Pipeline Automation — a real SageMaker Pipeline (Caption→Curate→Augment) | `ml.t3.medium` (CPU) + processing job |
| **M12** | — (ext) | HyperPod Distributed Training — a real 2-node `torch.distributed` DDP job | `ml.t3.medium` (CPU) + job nodes |

Recommended path: **M0 → M1 → M2 → M3**, then branch to synthetic data (M5/M6),
policy + simulation (M9/M10), search (M4), or production patterns (M12/M11).
Instances shown are the dashboard defaults; each GPU module also offers
alternatives (the dashboard only offers types the deploy region sells, and refuses one
whose quota is 0).

For how these modules map to the **8-stage pipeline** described in the AWS blog
post above, see [Participant Pre-Learning Guide § 2 "The 8-stage pipeline (and how
the modules map to it)"](PRE_LEARNING_GUIDE.md#the-8-stage-pipeline).

## Preview before you install

Want to see what the lab produces before deploying anything?

**Executed notebook results.** [`examples/notebooks-with-outputs.tar.gz`](../../examples/notebooks-with-outputs.tar.gz)
contains 12 module notebooks **with their output cells** from a real run — plots,
generated videos' metadata, metrics, and logs. Download and open them in any Jupyter
viewer to see each module's actual results **without installing or running
anything**. (Account-specific identifiers have been replaced with placeholders.)

> **The bundle predates the renumbering to blog-stage order**, so its filenames and
> the S3 paths printed in its outputs use the OLD numbers. It is left exactly as
> captured rather than relabelled, because rewriting the printed paths would falsify
> the execution record. Old → new: `M4`→M5, `M5`→M6, `M6`→M9, `M7`→M10, `M8`→M4,
> `M9`→M12, `M10`→M7; M0–M3 and M11 are unchanged. The new **M8** (Cosmos Reason
> LoRA SFT) is not in the bundle — it has no captured run yet.

**Admin dashboard.** The admin adds or removes participants here. Each row's
**Dashboard Link → Copy link** copies that participant's personal dashboard URL to
hand out, and the read-only **Region** column records the region the profile was
provisioned in — a Studio domain is regional, so a mis-provisioned participant would
otherwise look healthy. **Sessions** refreshes every 30 s; **Costs** charts the last
14 days of daily spend.

![Admin dashboard](../images/admin-dashboard.png)

**Participant dashboard.** Each participant opens their own dashboard to launch
their SageMaker workspace and run the notebooks. Its pipeline map lays the 12 modules
out in five phase columns — **INGEST → CURATE → AUGMENT → TRAIN → VALIDATE** — marks
each one completed, in progress or locked, and draws an arrow wherever one module's
output feeds another. One JupyterLab workspace serves every module, so the
participant points it at the instance the next notebook needs (CPU or GPU), starts
it, opens the workspace, and runs the notebook.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AWS Account | — | With SageMaker, S3, DynamoDB, Cognito, CloudFront access |
| AWS CLI | v2.x | Configured (`aws sts get-caller-identity`) |
| Node.js | 18+ | CDK CLI + frontend builds |
| Python | 3.12+ | CDK infrastructure code |
| AWS CDK | 2.x | `npm install -g aws-cdk` |
| jq | — | JSON parsing in deploy scripts |
| Hugging Face token | — | **Admin-only** — pre-caches gated models (M2/M5/M6/M9) and runs the M10 reference eval. **Participants need NO HF token.** See [PREREQUISITES.md](PREREQUISITES.md). |
| NGC API key | — | **Admin-only, M10 only** — the AlpaSim NuRec renderer image. |

### Service quotas (request early — 24–48 h lead time)

GPU **Studio JupyterLab App** quotas default to low or **0** on fresh accounts —
request increases before the workshop. There are also separate **job** quotas for
M12/M11 that are easy to miss. Full table + CLI commands: **[ADMIN_GUIDE.md](ADMIN_GUIDE.md)** and **[PREREQUISITES.md](PREREQUISITES.md)**.

Check what YOUR account has in the region you intend to deploy to — quota is scoped to
`(account × region)`, so a value in one region says nothing about another:

```bash
./scripts/check_quotas.py --region <region> --participants <cohort-size>
```

It cross-references live quota, what the region actually sells for Studio-JupyterLab, and the
instance each module recommends — and names the modules blocked by any shortfall. Measured in the reference
account: both us-west-2 and ap-northeast-2 pass at **5** concurrent participants and
neither passes at 10 — `ml.g5.12xlarge` and `ml.g5.xlarge` are quota 5 in both. Raise
those two to your headcount for a bigger room. `deploy.sh` runs this for you at the end of a deployment.

## Quick Start

All commands derive your account and region from the environment — nothing is
hardcoded.

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone <repository-url> av3.0-blueprint-lab
cd av3.0-blueprint-lab

# 2. Required environment variables
export ADMIN_EMAIL="<admin-email>"           # e.g. you@example.com
export REGION="us-west-2"                     # the ONE region to deploy to
export AWS_REGION="$REGION"                   # used by the seeding scripts below
export HF_TOKEN="hf_..."                      # admin Hugging Face read token
# Optional but recommended: restrict admin-dashboard access to your IP/CIDR
export ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST="203.0.113.0/24"    # default 0.0.0.0/0 = WAF open

# 2b. Accept gated model/dataset licenses on Hugging Face (before Step 6).
#     Log in to huggingface.co and click "Agree and access repository" on each
#     gated repo — full list in PREREQUISITES.md.

# 3. Bootstrap CDK (one-time per account + region)
cd infra && python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
npx cdk bootstrap "aws://$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)/$REGION"
cd ..

# 3b. Generate this region's instance rate table (REQUIRED).
#     The Lambdas raise at import without it rather than quote another region's
#     prices, so a missing table shows up as 500s on the instance endpoints.
./scripts/refresh_instance_rates.py --region "$REGION" --merge

# 4. Deploy infrastructure + dashboards (~25 min). Region is EXPLICIT — there is no
#    literal default anywhere in the deploy path.
./scripts/deploy.sh --region "$REGION"

# 5. Create the first Cognito admin user
#    (deploy.sh prints the exact command with your pool id; username MUST be an email)
aws cognito-idp admin-create-user \
    --user-pool-id <cognito-pool-id> \
    --username "$ADMIN_EMAIL" \
    --user-attributes Name=email,Value="$ADMIN_EMAIL" Name=email_verified,Value=true \
    --temporary-password 'TempPass1!' \
    --region "$AWS_REGION"

# 6. Pre-cache NVIDIA models to S3 (background, 30–60 min)
AWS_REGION="$REGION" ./scripts/cache_models.sh
#    This seeds model-cache/ ONLY (M2, M8). It does NOT seed the HuggingFace offline
#    cache that M5/M6/M9 read. Step 6b is not optional.

# 6b. Seed the HuggingFace offline cache — REQUIRED for M5, M6, M9, M10.
#     Two paths, both runnable. Pick by whether a seeded region already exists:
#  IF you already run the lab in another region (the usual case for region #2+):
ACCOUNT=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
SEEDED=us-west-2                      # a region where the lab already works
aws s3 sync "s3://av30lab-shared-data-$ACCOUNT-$SEEDED/hf-cache/" \
            "s3://av30lab-shared-data-$ACCOUNT-$REGION/hf-cache/" \
            --source-region "$SEEDED" --region "$REGION"       # ~115 GiB, 25-55 min
aws s3 sync "s3://av30lab-shared-data-$ACCOUNT-$SEEDED/m10-reference/" \
            "s3://av30lab-shared-data-$ACCOUNT-$REGION/m10-reference/" \
            --source-region "$SEEDED" --region "$REGION"
#     Sync hf-cache/ — NOT hf-cache/hub/ — or the tree nests one level too deep.
#  IF this is your FIRST region (nothing to copy from) — builds the tree from the pinned
#  manifest. No GPU, no notebook run; ~65 GiB scratch, 30-60 min:
AWS_REGION="$REGION" HF_TOKEN="$HF_TOKEN" ./scripts/cache_hf_tree.sh
#     M9 additionally needs its demo clip — ADMIN_GUIDE.md §6.3.
#
# 6c. VERIFY — must exit 0 BEFORE provisioning anyone. Skipping 6b ships a region
#     where M5/M6/M9/M10 cannot run, and every other check stays green.
./scripts/check_seeding.sh --region "$REGION"

# 7. Stage the nuScenes-mini dataset to S3 (required by M1 / M3 / M7)
AWS_REGION="$REGION" ./scripts/stage_nuscenes.sh
#    Pulls from the public AWS Open Data mirror (no login; nuScenes terms apply).

# 8. Upload notebook templates + helper scripts to the shared bucket
ACCOUNT=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
aws s3 sync notebooks/ "s3://av30lab-shared-data-$ACCOUNT-$REGION/notebook-templates/" --region "$REGION"
aws s3 sync scripts/   "s3://av30lab-shared-data-$ACCOUNT-$REGION/notebook-templates/scripts/" --region "$REGION"
```

Then open the **Admin Dashboard URL** printed by `deploy.sh`, log in with the
email + temporary password from Step 5, provision a test user, and open the
**Participant Dashboard Link** to verify the pipeline map. The full day-by-day
runbook — smoke test, bulk provisioning, monitoring, teardown — is in
**[ADMIN_GUIDE.md](ADMIN_GUIDE.md)**.

## Architecture

```

              │                    list_sessions, terminate_session,
              │                    change_instance, get_costs, update_progress, …
   ┌──────────┼───────────────────────────────┐
 Cognito   DynamoDB                    SageMaker Studio Domain
 (auth)    (sessions,                  └─ per-user profile + JupyterLab space
            progress)                        │
                                       S3 shared-data bucket
                                        (model-cache / datasets / hf-cache /
                                         notebook-templates / m10-reference)
```

- **Network:** NAT-free VPC with isolated private subnets and a free S3 *gateway* endpoint.
  There is **no NAT Gateway** — the Studio domain runs `PublicInternetOnly`, so notebook
  traffic egresses via a SageMaker-managed VPC and this VPC carries only EFS/home-dir
  traffic. The 6 paid *interface* endpoints are off by default (nothing in the VPC uses
  them: the Lambdas are not VPC-attached); enable with `-c vpc_interface_endpoints=true`
  if you switch the domain to `VpcOnly`.
- **Storage:** KMS-encrypted S3 (shared data + per-user workspaces); pre-cached models.
- **Compute:** SageMaker Studio Domain with a lifecycle config for auto-setup.
- **Auth:** Cognito user pool with an optional **WAF IP allowlist** for the admin plane.
- **API:** Lambda-backed REST API for user management, sessions, and progress.
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch alarms, SNS notifications, a daily budget alert.
- **Frontends:** React SPAs on CloudFront (admin dashboard + user pipeline map).

## Cost & cleanup

| Scenario | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Idle (infra only) | **~$1/mo per region** | KMS key. The S3 gateway endpoint is free and there is no NAT Gateway; DynamoDB (on-demand), CloudFront and Cognito are ~$0 at idle. Add **~$87.60/mo per region** only if you enable the 6 VPC interface endpoints (12 ENIs x $0.01/AZ-hour). S3 storage for the model cache is extra (~$2/mo per region). |
| GPU modules | per-hour | `ml.g5.xlarge` ~$1.41/hr (M7), `ml.g5.12xlarge` ~$7.09/hr (M2/M3), `ml.g5.12xlarge` is also the M5/M6/M8/M9 default. Full-resolution output needs ≥38 GB/GPU: `ml.g7e.2xlarge` ~$4.20/hr is the cheapest route (1× 96 GB — cheaper than the default, but quota defaults to 0 and it is unverified here), `ml.p4d.24xlarge` ~$25.25/hr otherwise |
| M10 AlpaSim on EC2 | ~$30 one-time (admin) | reference eval on `g6e.12xlarge`; optional participant self-run ~$10.5/hr/host |
| Full week (mixed) | ~$400–600+ | dominated by the p4d modules and user count |

**Cost controls:** daily budget alarm (SNS → `<admin-email>`), admin
force-terminate from the Sessions tab, and idle auto-stop of
JupyterLab apps (90 min default; `-c idle_timeout_minutes=<60..180>`). **Teardown:** `scripts/teardown.sh` (dry-run by default; `--yes`,
`--user <id>`, `--destroy`) removes per-user apps/spaces/profiles, sweeps orphaned
OpenSearch Serverless collections, and terminates tagged GPU EC2 hosts. After the
event, **revoke the admin HF token and rotate the NGC key**. Details in
[ADMIN_GUIDE.md](ADMIN_GUIDE.md).

## Region selection

Region is chosen per deployment with `./scripts/deploy.sh --region <region>` — one region
at a time. See [docs/en/ADDING_A_REGION.md](ADDING_A_REGION.md) to add another later.

Two DIFFERENT facts decide whether a GPU type is usable, and the old table here conflated
them — it marked `ml.p5.48xlarge` available in us-east-1 when this account has quota 0 there,
and implied only three regions were possible when the p5 quota actually exists in ten:

1. **Does the region sell it for Studio-JupyterLab?** Generated, measured per region
   (`$/hr`, `—` = not sold there):

   | Region | g5.12xlarge | g5.24xlarge | g6.24xlarge | g7e.2xlarge | p4d.24xlarge | p5.48xlarge |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | us-west-2 | $7.09 | $10.18 | $8.34 | $4.20 | $25.25 | $63.30 |
   | us-east-1 | $7.09 | $10.18 | $8.34 | $4.20 | $25.25 | $63.30 |
   | ap-northeast-1 | $10.28 | $14.76 | $12.10 | — | $34.61 | $79.12 |
   | ap-northeast-2 | $8.72 | $12.52 | $10.26 | — | $34.97 | — |
   | eu-west-1 | $7.92 | $11.36 | — | — | $27.27 | — |

   Regenerate, or add a region, with:
   `./scripts/refresh_instance_rates.py --region <region> --merge`
   A region with no generated table makes the Lambdas raise at import rather than quote
   another region's prices.

2. **Does YOUR account have quota, in THAT region, for your cohort size?** Quota is scoped to
   `(account × region)` — an increase approved in one region does nothing for another — and
   the default for big GPU types is often 0. Check before you commit to a region:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/check_quotas.py --region <region> --participants 10
   ```

   It cross-references the rate table, live quotas, and the modules' recommended instances.
   Measured for this account: both us-west-2 and ap-northeast-2 run every recommended
   type for **5** concurrent participants, the cap in both being quota 5 on
   `ml.g5.12xlarge`/`ml.g5.xlarge`. ap-northeast-2 has quota **0** for the whole `ml.g6`
   family and does not sell `ml.g7e.*`/`ml.p5.*` at all, which is why nothing the
   dashboard recommends is a `g6` type.

S3 model-cache paths are region-local — stage data into the region you deploy to
(`AWS_REGION=<region> ./scripts/cache_models.sh`; the script refuses to guess).
