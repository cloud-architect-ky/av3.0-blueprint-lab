"""Lambda handler for changing a session's instance type.

PATCH /sessions/{id}/instance-type

Split into a fast synchronous request path and an asynchronous continuation:

* Sync path (`_http_handler`): validate, issue the app delete (instant, async
  server-side), then self-invoke this same function with InvocationType='Event'
  and return 200 immediately. The whole cycle (delete -> wait -> update_space ->
  wait -> create_app) can take minutes, but API Gateway's REST integration is
  capped at 29s — a synchronous handler always 504s, and that 504 has no CORS
  headers so the browser sees "Failed to fetch". Returning fast avoids the 504
  entirely; the frontend polls GET /sessions/{id}/app-status for the outcome.

* Async path (`_apply_async`): the slow tail. Runs within the 15-min Lambda
  timeout. Persists the new instanceType to DynamoDB only AFTER create_app
  succeeds, so the previous type stays a valid rollback target and we never
  record a type that isn't actually running. (It is NOT what makes the 409
  "already set" guard work — that reads the live app via _live_app_state.)

Issuing delete_app on the SYNC path (before returning) flips the old app to
Deleting before the frontend's first poll, so the poller can't latch onto the
pre-change app as InService and stop early.

    # with new == previous and got a 409. Both escape routes were then closed:
    #   * the frontend treats 409 as a no-op and starts polling GET /app-status, which
    #     stays "NotFound" forever because nothing created an app;
