# --- Region model: ONE region per deployment --------------------------------

# a second region is a SEPARATE, independent deployment of the same stack — its own Studio
# domain, buckets, API, Cognito pool, dashboards and budget. See
# docs/en/ADDING_A_REGION.md.
#
# A multi-region control plane (REGION_CONFIG / TARGET_REGIONS / CONTROL_REGION plus
# client_for / domain_id_for / buckets_for / region_config) used to live here for a design
# where one control plane governed Studio domains in up to three regions. It was REMOVED,
# not just disabled, because:
#
#   * The CDK never set REGION_CONFIG or CONTROL_REGION, so it always collapsed to the
#     single deploy region — it was never exercised.
#   * The four cross-region factories had ZERO call sites in any handler.
#   * Left in place, a future change that populated REGION_CONFIG would silently convert
#     two independent labs into one control plane managing both, which is the opposite of
#     the chosen model — and the conversion would look like a config change, not a
#     redesign.
#
# The scalars above (SAGEMAKER_DOMAIN_ID, SHARED_BUCKET_NAME, USER_BUCKET_NAME, the image
# ARNs, the LCC ARN) describe THIS deployment's one region and are the only source of
# regional identity. AWS_REGION is a Lambda RESERVED variable, always populated by the
# runtime, so it is exactly "the region this deployment runs in".
#
# Participant rows still carry a `region` attribute. It is written once at provisioning and
# is IMMUTABLE — a UserProfile belongs to one Domain and a Domain is regional, so "move this
# participant" does not exist, only delete and re-provision. It is kept as a record of which
# deployment owns the row (useful when one team runs two regional labs), NOT as an
# instruction to act cross-region.

# NOTE the trailing dots: they are load-bearing. "ml.g6e.24xlarge" does NOT start

# SageMaker instance rates (USD per hour) — THE authoritative table for this repo.
#
# SOURCE OF TRUTH: generated per region by scripts/refresh_instance_rates.py from the AWS
# Price List API (ServiceCode=AmazonSageMaker, platoinstancetype=Studio-JupyterLab). Never
# hand-edit instance_rates.py.
#
# This was a single hand-maintained us-west-2 snapshot that ALSO served as the participant
# instance allowlist (VALID_INSTANCE_TYPES in change_instance, and the dropdown built by
# instance_options). Both halves were wrong outside us-west-2, and both failed quietly:
#
#   * PRICES. ap-northeast-2 is ~+23% on every type (measured: t3.medium 0.050 -> 0.062,
#     g5.12xlarge 7.09 -> 8.718, g6.24xlarge 8.344 -> 10.26). Every figure shown to a
#     participant and every admin session estimate read ~23% LOW — the wrong direction for
#     a lab whose documented failure mode is spend nobody noticed.
#   * OFFERINGS. The keys were offered regardless of region, so a participant could pick a
#     type the region does not sell for Studio and their app simply failed to start.
#     Measured, per region, for the curated candidate set:
#         us-west-2 / us-east-1   34/35
#         ap-northeast-1          28/35   (no g7e)
#         ap-northeast-2          27/35   (no g7e, no p5)
#         eu-west-1               21/35   (no g6 family AT ALL, no g7e, no p5)
#     ml.p3.2xlarge has no Studio-JupyterLab product in any of the five.
#
# A region that has not been generated raises at import. That is deliberate: the previous
# behaviour — quote us-west-2 and hope — is exactly the silent-wrongness this replaces.
#
# NOT A QUOTA. A rate here only means the region SELLS the type. Whether this account may
# launch it is a separate per-(account x region) fact: ml.g6.* is priced in ap-northeast-2
# but its Studio quota there is 0.
#
# NOTHING IN THE REQUEST PATH CHECKS QUOTA TODAY. An earlier version of this comment said
# "instance_options resolves live quota at request time" — that was false: instance_options
# is dead code (zero call sites, keyed to placeholder module ids, imports no boto3), and
# change_instance validates only membership in this table. So a participant can still pick
# a type this region sells but the account has 0 quota for, and the failure surfaces as a
# stalled app rather than a rejection. The admin-side check is
# scripts/check_quotas.py --region <r> --participants N, which deploy.sh runs at the end of
# a deployment; wiring a GetServiceQuota call into change_instance is the real fix and has
# not been done.
#
# GPU GEOMETRY (the recurring source of confusion — size is NOT GPU count, and within a
# family a bigger size adds GPUs, never per-GPU VRAM):
#   g4dn = T4 16 GB | g5 = A10G 24 GB | g6 = L4 24 GB (NOT L40S — that is g6e)
#   g7e  = RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell 96 GB | p4d = A100 40 GB | p5 = H100 80 GB
#   4-GPU sizes: g5/g6 .12xlarge and .24xlarge ;  8-GPU: .48xlarge
#   g7e differs: 2xl/4xl/8xl = 1 GPU, 12xl = 2, 24xl = 4, 48xl = 8
# M5/M6 branch on PER-GPU VRAM (>=38 GB -> 720p + guardrails ON), and M9 on >=40 GB
# (single-GPU "verified path"). So no g5/g6 size reaches the top tier; g7e (96 GB), p4d
# (40 GB) and p5 (80 GB) do. 24 GB cards still COMPLETE the lab — see
# docs/en/ALPAMAYO_M9.md "Verified runs" (minADE 0.3779 m, Status: PASS).

    Prices and quotas are independent facts. A type can be priced here (so it passes the
    INSTANCE_RATES allowlist) yet have a quota of 0, in which case SageMaker accepts
    CreateApp and the app then fails to start. Measured in ap-northeast-2: the entire
    ml.g6.* family is priced but quota 0. Resolving the quota BEFORE acting turns that
    into an immediate, explainable rejection.

    One GetServiceQuota call (~55-110 ms measured) using the code baked into
    instance_rates.QUOTA_CODES — as opposed to paginating 2,258 SageMaker quotas, which is
    why the code is generated ahead of time and only the VALUE is fetched live.

    Returns None — meaning "unknown, do not block" — for every case where the number
    cannot be trusted, because blocking on a bad read would deny a type the account
    legitimately owns:

      * no code for the type (region has no such quota; a raise cannot be requested either)
      * NoSuchResourceException (the code is not offered in this region)
      * AccessDeniedException (the servicequotas grant is missing — must degrade, not fail)
      * throttling or any other ClientError

    Callers MUST therefore branch on `== 0`, never on falsiness: `not 0.0` and `not None`
    are both True, which would collapse "quota is zero" into "unknown" and vice versa.
