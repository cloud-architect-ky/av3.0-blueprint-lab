# of models into the ALREADY-POPULATED first region's bucket, printing
# "Region: us-west-2" the whole time — which reads as success.
#
# deploy.sh baited that trap by printing "HF_TOKEN=xxx ./scripts/cache_models.sh" with
# no region: deploy.sh exports AWS_REGION in its OWN process, which does not survive
