"""Patch AV3.0 tutorial notebooks to reference the ACTUAL deployed AWS resources.

The notebooks ship with hardcoded bucket names (three different, all wrong),
inconsistent profile env-var names, and model-cache / nuScenes prefixes that do
not match what is staged in S3. This script rewrites, in place, only the config
cell (and a couple of body lines) of each notebook — preserving cell outputs and
metadata so the diff stays minimal.

Config resolution after patching (single canonical scheme):
    USER_PROFILE  <- os.environ["USER_PROFILE"]  (injected by the JupyterLab LCC)
    SHARED_BUCKET <- os.environ["SHARED_BUCKET"]  (fallback av30lab-shared-data-<acct>)
    USER_BUCKET   <- os.environ["USER_BUCKET"]    (fallback av30lab-user-workspace-<acct>)

Run from the repo root:  python3 scripts/patch_notebooks.py
Idempotent: safe to re-run (string replacements are no-ops once applied).
